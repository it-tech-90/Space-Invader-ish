<h1>Space Invader-ish (kinda)</h1>
<h2>In Python</h2>
<p>My very first game I created with models to work with in Python. This game contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A score tracker</li>
  <li>A health bar</li>
  <li>Bullet/enemy collision detection</li>
  <li>Enemy/player collision detection</li>
  <li>Game Over screen with input checks</li>
</ul>

<p>I might decide to add more to this later on, but it is functional now</p>
